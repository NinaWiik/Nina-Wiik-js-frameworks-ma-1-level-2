1. HTML
We are going to make a div with an id slider for the main container, and a container that 
holds all the pictures. We also need a div that contains the arrows and a pager. 

I have used bootstrap for this, and it can be added in the head. 
``` <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">```
You also have to link to your stylesheet in the head. 
In the footer, you need to include the JQuery Library. You add the code before the closing of the body tag. 
You have to add the JQuery, before you add your own script file. 

```<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>```
